A robin sings away on high
His wondrous melody to the sky
It's so beautiful it's no wonder why,
I sit and think of you

In spring the crocus and the daffodil
Towards the sun, their colours spill,
Through all this glory, I shall still
Lie here and think of you

When summer is across the land,
I think of surf, of stone and sand
And dream of walking hand in hand
As I sit and think of you

Autum's colours and gentle mist
The hunting owls, they hoot and twist
Do you know how much you're missed?
As I walk and dream of you

On Christmas day we must not chat,
Without such talk, it will be flat
No message from me, but despite all that
Just know I'll think of you
