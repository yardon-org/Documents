A robin sings away on high
His wondrous melody to the sky
It's so beautiful it's no wonder why,
I sit and think of you

When summer is across the land,
I think of surf, of stone and sand
And dream of walking hand in hand
As I sit and think of you

In spring the crocus and the daffodil
To the sun, their colours spill,
Do you know that I will still
Lie here and think of you

On Christmas day we must not chat,
Without such talk, it will be flat
No message from me, but despite all that
I'll still sit and think of you
